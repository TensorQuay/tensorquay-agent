# Changelog

Each release of TensorQuay Agent, newest first. A fix release changes no capability, migration or protocol
([DEV-PLAN §7](docs/DEV-PLAN.md)).

## 17.2 (8 November 2026)

A fix release: no migration, no protocol change.

### Fixed

- **A slow local model passes its check (GW-U-092).** A local route whose model passed the check's tool call and
  round trip, and then ran out of time in the check's last step, failed with "timeout". It now passes, with
  "Verified, but slowly" and the step it didn't finish named (`line_breaks_unverified`). Running out of time before
  the round trip still fails; hosted routes keep their minute.
- **Applications opened from a Desktop session's shell reach the display (TOOL-U-141).** The shell cleared its
  commands' environment, so the desktop's `DISPLAY` and session bus never reached them and an application failed with
  "cannot open display". A Desktop session's commands now get both; other shells never do.
- **Adaptive thinking is shown, summarized (LLM-U-055, LLM-U-057).** On the newer Messages models the thinking text
  is omitted unless asked for, so the task page showed "Thinking…" with nothing to read. A route with adaptive
  thinking now asks for summaries, and the page's live thinking shows what the model works through.
- **The channel page says which agents aren't running (WEB-U-426).** An agent reads a channel only while its task
  runs. Above the message box, the page now counts the agents that aren't running, says to open each one's task and
  ask it to work in the channel (or to ask its owner, for another person's agent), and lists them with their tasks
  linked. English and Simplified Chinese; the user guide says the same.

### Upgrade notes

- No migration. A route's check verdict is read again at its next check.

## 17.1 (7 November 2026)

A fix release: no migration, no protocol change.

### Fixed

- **Adaptive thinking on Messages routes (LLM-U-055, LLM-U-057).** Newer Messages models refuse a thinking budget.
  A Messages route whose reasoning policy has no `budget_tokens` now sends adaptive thinking with the request's
  effort, and refuses a temperature. Such a route sends no earlier thinking blocks back: the protocol binds each
  block to the conversation before it, and the agent's history changes between steps. Routes with budgets are
  unchanged.
- **The conversation is cached, not only its prefix (LLM-U-056).** With a Messages route's cache hint set, the latest
  message carries a cache breakpoint too.
- **A stalled accessibility tree never holds the screen (TOOL-U-138).** Each tree call is bounded (3 s; a whole
  window's walk 10 s). Past the bound the screenshot is still sent, without that application's elements.
- **No marks where the tree's positions are wrong (TOOL-U-139).** An element whose box lies outside the focused
  window's frame gets no mark; it stays listed for its accessibility actions.
- **Typed line breaks and tabs are keys (TOOL-U-140).** Text typed into a desktop application goes in runs with real
  Return and Tab keys between them.
- **Spreadsheet reading uses calamine 0.38.0** (RUSTSEC-2026-0436).

### Upgrade notes

- No migration. A route saved with adaptive thinking can't be read by 17.0: a gateway taken back to 17.0 refuses to
  start while such a route is stored. Delete those routes before going back.

## 17.0 (3 November 2026)

The initial release: an on-premise AI agent platform with sandboxed agents on Docker or Firecracker microVMs,
a web UI, a desktop environment for computer use, and channels where agents and people work together. What it does
and how to install it is in the [README](README.md).
